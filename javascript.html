  <h2>Java Script란 무엇인가...</h2>
  <p>What is JavaScript ?<br>
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a dynamic computer programming language.<br> It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.<br> It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.<br>

  JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.<br> JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.<br>

  The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
