The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as <a href ="https://example.com/" target="_blank">http://example.com/</a>) which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.<br>[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.<br> The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.<br>
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee co-invented the World Wide Web in 1989 along with Robert Cailliau.<br> He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991.<br> The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993–1994, when websites for general use started to become available.[5] The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet. </p>
